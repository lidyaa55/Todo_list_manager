# # Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a console-based To-Do List Manager application in C++ to further my learning and proficiency in the language. This software demonstrates key concepts such as object-oriented programming, the use of Standard Template Library (STL) containers, and fundamental control structures like conditionals and loops.

The To-Do List Manager allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, removing, and viewing tasks. This project helps me practice organizing code with classes and functions, ensuring modularity and readability, and working with dynamic data structures.

Through this software, I aim to deepen my understanding of C++ syntax and features, focusing on its application in real-world problem-solving.

# Development Environment

The project was developed using the following tools:

- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Compiler**: g++ (part of GCC) version 11.3.0

The software was written in **C++**, utilizing the Standard Template Library (STL) for the `std::vector` container to manage task data.

# Future Work

Here are some improvements and features I plan to add to the application in the future:

- Enhance error handling to provide better feedback for invalid inputs.
- Implement a feature to edit existing tasks.
- Add functionality to save and load tasks from a file for persistent storage.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly.
